# See also https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format
#   Entries without a slash are treated as globs (match in any directory).
#   Ending '/' matches directories only (as globs).
#   Leading '/' matches search root (location of .gitignore)
#   Leading '.' character has to be matched explicitly.
#   The '*' does not match '/' (use '**' to match >1 nested directories).
